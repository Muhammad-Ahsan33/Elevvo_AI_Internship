# Elevvo_AI_Internship
Machine Learning Internship Projects
A collection of machine learning tasks completed during my internship, covering both regression and classification problems.

Task 1 – Student Score Prediction: Linear Regression model to predict exam scores based on study hours.

Task 2 – Customer Segmentation: K-Means clustering on customer spending data with cluster visualization.

Task 3 – Forest Cover Type Classification: Multi-class classification using tree-based models with class imbalance handling.

Task 4 – Loan Approval Prediction: Binary classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and tuned Random Forest, with evaluation metrics, ROC curves, and feature importance analysis.

Includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison for each task.
